IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

PCB featuring 3.5mm audio inputs and ouputs, an audio CODEC IC, bare-metal STM32 board for implementing DSP algorithms, and a small i2c LED display for displaying information pertaining to the audio effects implemented on the DSP. Features programmable potentiometers and buttons for use in DSP implementations. Battery powered for ease of use.

## Educational Value Added
This project teaches about PCB design, power electronics, baremetal C programming practices, and DSP for audio applications (many concepts in this field are widely applicable to general DSP).
