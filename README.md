## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

PCB featuring 3.5mm audio inputs and outputs, an audio CODEC for high-quality audio sampling and reconstruction, bare-metal STM32 board for implementing DSP algorithms, and a small i2c LED display for displaying information pertaining to the audio effects implemented on the STM32 (real-time display). Features programmable potentiometers and buttons for use in DSP implementations. Battery powered for ease of use when travelling. The system is intended as a portable, real-time audio effects processor for general listening applications.

## Educational Value Added
This project teaches about PCB design, power electronics, bare-metal C programming practices, and DSP for audio applications (which includes topics widely applicable to general DSP). Audio-specific communication protocols such as i2s would also be taught with the completion of this project.
